In Android 17, apps targeting SDK 37 or higher will receive a new implementation of MessageQueue where the implementation is lock-free. The new implementation improves performance and reduces missed frames, but may break clients that reflect on MessageQueue private fields and methods. To learn more about the behavior change and how you can mitigate impact, [check out the MessageQueue behavior change documentation](http://developer.android.com/about/versions/17/changes/messagequeue). This technical blog post provides an overview of the MessageQueue rearchitecture and how you can analyze lock contention issues using Perfetto.

The [Looper](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Looper) drives the UI thread of every Android application. It pulls work from a [MessageQueue](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/MessageQueue), dispatches it to a [Handler](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler), and repeats. For two decades, MessageQueue used a single monitor lock (i.e. a synchronized code block) to protect its state.

Android 17 introduces a significant update to this component: a lock-free implementation named DeliQueue.

This post explains how locks affect UI performance, how to analyze these issues with Perfetto, and the specific algorithms and optimizations used to improve the Android main thread.

The problem: Lock Contention and Priority Inversion

The legacy MessageQueue functioned as a priority queue protected by a single lock. If a background thread posts a message while the main thread performs queue maintenance, the background thread blocks the main thread.

When two or more threads are competing for exclusive use of the same lock, this is called Lock contention. This contention can cause Priority Inversion, leading to UI jank and other performance problems.

Priority inversion can happen when a high-priority thread (like the UI thread) is made to wait for a low-priority thread. Consider this sequence:

1. A low priority background thread acquires the MessageQueue lock to post the result of work that it did.
2. A medium priority thread becomes runnable and the Kernel's scheduler allocates it CPU time, preempting the low priority thread.
3. The high priority UI thread finishes its current task and attempts to read from the queue, but is blocked because the low priority thread holds the lock.

The low-priority thread blocks the UI thread, and the medium-priority work delays it further.

![A visual representation of priority inversion. It shows 'Task L' (Low) holding a lock, blocking 'Task H' (High). 'Task M' (Medium) then preempts 'Task L', effectively delaying 'Task H' for the duration of 'Task M's' execution.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi5lpXcJrA3CKIi_DnPnYtJ8bfc3vCrdPHToFuPs6CBRpRCjILPIoTP8Z7m_tpfjLWByWLM1I0UlgacedkHg6iAhlj4Ls7v-EmmRAGvcj9WDB_j095S0SECKZkuU89Bb70vDw-B3CiOWkSuu1KAH6-Z-RLN7zjVJgtqitER1Gl6pMgGEnrWtLp9ebS36JY=s16000)

Analyzing contention with Perfetto

You can diagnose these issues using [Perfetto](https://perfetto.dev/). In a standard trace, a thread blocked on a monitor lock enters the sleeping state, and Perfetto shows a slice indicating the lock owner.

When you query trace data, look for slices named “monitor contention with …” followed by the name of the thread that owns the lock and the code site where the lock was acquired.

Case study: Launcher jank

To illustrate, let’s analyze a trace where a user experienced jank while navigating home on a Pixel phone immediately after taking a photo in the camera app. Below we see a screenshot of Perfetto showing the events leading up to the missed frame:

![A Perfetto trace screenshot diagnosing the Launcher jank. The 'Actual Timeline' shows a red missed frame. Coinciding with this, the main thread track contains a large green slice labeled 'monitor contention with owner BackgroundExecutor,' indicating that the UI thread was blocked because a background thread held the MessageQueue lock.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEivHqJIUgTNsk5JKoL8qpiO3vjFfZp-78mTBYD6zWLWbIpQih5o2P-1YdJU57ZEQ2zT959seF1rPzzAmdOFUcMhZqUr67u3YFk5UlqR7UdgVMYpnGU-oFcpEhMtOzaD-8KxTGtaQyL1FpkUqsluy4-cz40e4yzqmiUvG06qmXYd66QnODo-IZJ0tdfps0Q/s16000/cTMPgSaPAotGcAJ.png)

- Symptom: The Launcher main thread missed its frame deadline. It blocked for 18ms, which exceeds the 16ms deadline required for 60Hz rendering.
- Diagnosis: Perfetto showed the main thread blocked on the MessageQueue lock. A “BackgroundExecutor” thread owned the lock.
- Root Cause: The BackgroundExecutor runs at [Process.THREAD\_PRIORITY\_BACKGROUND](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Process#THREAD_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND) (very low priority). It performed a non-urgent task (checking [app usage limits](https://www.android.com/digital-wellbeing/)). Simultaneously, medium priority threads were using CPU time to process data from the camera. The OS scheduler preempted the BackgroundExecutor thread to run the camera threads.

This sequence caused the Launcher’s UI thread (high priority) to become indirectly blocked by the camera worker thread (medium priority), which was keeping the Launcher’s background thread (low priority) from releasing the lock.

Querying traces with PerfettoSQL

You can use [PerfettoSQL](https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/perfetto-sql-getting-started) to [query trace data](https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/batch-trace-processor) for specific patterns. This is useful if you have a large bank of traces from user devices or tests, and you’re searching for specific traces that demonstrate a problem.

For example, this query finds MessageQueue contention coincident with dropped frames (jank):

```adb-detail__content
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.monitor_contention;
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.jank_type;

SELECT
  process_name,
  -- Convert duration from nanoseconds to milliseconds
  SUM(dur) / 1000000 AS sum_dur_ms,
  COUNT(*) AS count_contention
FROM android_monitor_contention
WHERE is_blocked_thread_main
AND short_blocked_method LIKE "%MessageQueue%"

-- Only look at app processes that had jank
AND upid IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT(upid)
  FROM actual_frame_timeline_slice
  WHERE android_is_app_jank_type(jank_type) = TRUE
)
GROUP BY process_name
ORDER BY SUM(dur) DESC;
```

In this more complex example, join trace data that spans multiple tables to identify MessageQueue contention during app startup:

```adb-detail__content
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.monitor_contention;
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.startups;

-- Join package and process information for startups
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS startups;
CREATE VIEW startups AS
SELECT startup_id, ts, dur, upid
FROM android_startups
JOIN android_startup_processes USING(startup_id);

-- Intersect monitor contention with startups in the same process.
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS monitor_contention_during_startup;
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE monitor_contention_during_startup
USING SPAN_JOIN(android_monitor_contention PARTITIONED upid, startups PARTITIONED upid);

SELECT
  process_name,
  SUM(dur) / 1000000 AS sum_dur_ms,
  COUNT(*) AS count_contention
FROM monitor_contention_during_startup
WHERE is_blocked_thread_main
AND short_blocked_method LIKE "%MessageQueue%"
GROUP BY process_name
ORDER BY SUM(dur) DESC;
```

You can use your favorite LLM to write PerfettoSQL queries to find other patterns.

At Google, we use [BigTrace](https://perfetto.dev/docs/deployment/deploying-bigtrace-on-a-single-machine) to run PerfettoSQL queries across millions of traces. In doing so, we confirmed that what we saw anecdotally was, in fact, a systemic issue. The data revealed that MessageQueue lock contention impacts users across the entire ecosystem, substantiating the need for a fundamental architectural change.

Solution: lock-free concurrency

We addressed the MessageQueue contention problem by implementing a lock-free data structure, using atomic memory operations rather than exclusive locks to synchronize access to shared state. A data structure or algorithm is lock-free if at least one thread can always make progress regardless of the scheduling behavior of the other threads. This property is generally hard to achieve, and is [usually not worth pursuing for most code](https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/atomic_danger).

The atomic primitives

Lock-free software often relies on atomic Read-Modify-Write primitives that the hardware provides.

On older generation ARM64 CPUs, atomics used a Load-Link/Store-Conditional (LL/SC) loop. The CPU loads a value and marks the address. If another thread writes to that address, the store fails, and the loop retries. Because the threads can keep trying and succeed without waiting for another thread, this operation is lock-free.

```adb-detail__content
ARM64 LL/SC loop example
retry:
    ldxr    x0, [x1]        // Load exclusive from address x1 to x0
    add     x0, x0, #1      // Increment value by 1
    stxr    w2, x0, [x1]    // Store exclusive.
                            // w2 gets 0 on success, 1 on failure
    cbnz    w2, retry       // If w2 is non-zero (failed), branch to retr
```

([view in Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/GPs9GeGhG))

Newer ARM architectures (ARMv8.1) support Large System Extensions (LSE) which include instructions in the form of Compare-And-Swap (CAS) or Load-And-Add (demonstrated below). In Android 17 we added support to the Android Runtime (ART) compiler to detect when LSE is supported and emit optimized instructions:

```adb-detail__content
/ ARMv8.1 LSE atomic example
ldadd   x0, x1, [x2]    // Atomic load-add.
                        // Faster, no loop required.
```

In our benchmarks, high-contention code that uses CAS achieves a ~3x speedup over the LL/SC variant.

The Java programming language offers atomic primitives via [java.util.concurrent.atomic](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/atomic/package-summary) that rely on these and other specialized CPU instructions.

The Data Structure: DeliQueue

To remove lock contention from MessageQueue, our engineers designed a novel data structure called DeliQueue. DeliQueue separates Message insertion from Message processing:

1. The list of Messages (Treiber stack): A lock-free stack. Any thread can push new Messages here without contention.
2. The priority queue (Min-heap): A heap of Messages to handle, exclusively owned by the Looper thread (hence no synchronization or locks are needed to access).

### Enqueue: pushing to a Treiber stack

The list of Messages is kept in a Treiber stack \[1\], a lock-free stack that uses a CAS loop to update the head pointer.

```adb-detail__content
public class TreiberStack <E> {
    AtomicReference<Node<E>> top =
            new AtomicReference<Node<E>>();
    public void push(E item) {
        Node<E> newHead = new Node<E>(item);
        Node<E> oldHead;
        do {
            oldHead = top.get();
            newHead.next = oldHead;
        } while (!top.compareAndSet(oldHead, newHead));
    }

    public E pop() {
        Node<E> oldHead;
        Node<E> newHead;
        do {
            oldHead = top.get();
            if (oldHead == null) return null;
            newHead = oldHead.next;
        } while (!top.compareAndSet(oldHead, newHead));
        return oldHead.item;
    }
}
```

Source code based on Java Concurrency in Practice \[2\], [available online](https://jcip.net/listings/ConcurrentStack.java) and released to the public domain

Any producer can push new Messages to the stack at any time. This is like pulling a ticket at a deli counter - your number is determined by when you showed up, but the order you get your food in doesn't have to match. Because it's a linked stack, every Message is a sub-stack - you can see what the Message queue was like at any point in time by tracking the head and iterating forwards - you won't see any new Messages pushed on top, even if they're being added during your traversal.

### Dequeue: bulk transfer to a min-heap

To find the next Message to handle, the Looper processes new Messages from the Treiber stack by walking the stack starting from the top and iterating until it finds the last Message that it previously processed. As the Looper traverses down the stack, it inserts Messages into the deadline-ordered min-heap. Since the Looper exclusively owns the heap, it orders and processes Messages without locks or atomics.

![A system diagram illustrating the DeliQueue architecture. Concurrent producer threads (left) push messages onto a shared 'Lock-Free Treiber Stack' using atomic CAS operations. The single consumer 'Looper Thread' (right) claims these messages via an atomic swap, merges them into a private 'Local Min-heap' sorted by timestamp, and then executes them.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhknkVSDfMX-ZahCjfG4tSxzMtW4QHU0mzm_9vw2wXNMM1DY3oOy-sHeejjN-huSAGJAjVJzl47NUlVlVKNswK4KHkW0dTCEoeIZqYspMEI6KIy56S9d0AQWUMa1amuWA6WAWr1naU4_5SrqSr1GYzMsekgmJgjcs43lb4C5YGznm6g3AC3uwAQDFZJnLk=s16000)

In walking down the stack, the Looper also creates links from stacked Messages back to their predecessors, thus forming a doubly-linked list. Creating the linked list is safe because links pointing down the stack are added via the Treiber stack algorithm with CAS, and links up the stack are only ever read and modified by the Looper thread. These back links are then used to remove Messages from arbitrary points in the stack in O(1) time.

This design provides *O*(1) insertion for producers (threads posting work to the queue) and amortized *O*(log N) processing for the consumer (the Looper).

Using a min-heap to order Messages also addresses a fundamental flaw in the legacy MessageQueue, where Messages were kept in a singly-linked list (rooted at the top). In the legacy implementation, removal from the head was *O*(1), but insertion had a worst case of *O(N)* – scaling poorly for overloaded queues! Conversely, insertion to and removal from the min-heap scale logarithmically, delivering competitive average performance but really excelling in tail latencies.

|  | Legacy (locked) MessageQueue | DeliQueue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Insert | *O(N)* | *O*(1) for calling thread  *O(logN)* for Looper thread |
| Remove from head | *O*(1) | *O(logN)* |

In the legacy queue implementation, producers and the consumer used a lock to coordinate exclusive access to the underlying singly-linked list. In DeliQueue, the Treiber stack handles concurrent access, and the single consumer handles ordering its work queue.

Removal: consistency via tombstones

DeliQueue is a hybrid data structure, joining a lock-free Treiber stack with a single-threaded min-heap. Keeping these two structures in sync without a global lock presents a unique challenge: a message might be physically present in the stack but logically removed from the queue.

To solve this, DeliQueue uses a technique called “tombstoning.” Each Message tracks its position in the stack via the backwards and forwards pointers, its index in the heap’s array, and a boolean flag indicating whether it has been removed. When a Message is ready to run, the Looper thread will CAS its removed flag, then remove it from the heap and stack.

When another thread needs to remove a Message, it doesn't immediately extract it from the data structure. Instead, it performs the following steps:

1. Logical removal: the thread uses a CAS to atomically set the Message’s removal flag from false to true. The Message remains in the data structure as evidence of its pending removal, a so-called “tombstone”. Once a Message is flagged for removal, DeliQueue treats it as if it no longer exists in the queue whenever it’s found.
2. Deferred cleanup: The actual removal from the data structure is the responsibility of the Looper thread, and is deferred until later. Rather than modifying the stack or heap, the remover thread adds the Message to another lock-free freelist stack.
3. Structural removal: Only the Looper can interact with the heap or remove elements from the stack. When it wakes up, it clears the freelist and processes the Messages it contained. Each Message is then unlinked from the stack and removed from the heap.

This approach keeps all management of the heap single-threaded. It minimizes the number of concurrent operations and memory barriers required, making the critical path faster and simpler.

### Traversal: benign Java memory model data races

Most concurrency APIs, such as Future in the Java standard library, or Kotlin’s Job and Deferred, include a mechanism to cancel work before it completes. An instance of one of these classes matches 1:1 with a unit of underlying work, and calling cancel on an object cancels the specific operations associated with them.

Today’s Android devices have multi-core CPUs and concurrent, generational garbage collection. But when Android was first developed, it was too expensive to allocate one object for each unit of work. Consequently, Android’s Handler supports cancellation via numerous overloads of removeMessages - rather than removing a specific Message, it removes all Messages that match the specified criteria. In practice, this requires iterating through all Messages inserted before removeMessages was called and removing the ones that match.

When iterating forward, a thread only requires one ordered atomic operation, to read the current head of the stack. After that, ordinary field reads are used to find the next Message. If the Looper thread modifies the next fields while removing Messages, the Looper’s write and another thread’s read are unsynchronized - this is a data race. Normally, a data race is a serious bug that can cause huge problems in your app - leaks, infinite loops, crashes, freezes, and more. However, under certain narrow conditions, data races can be benign within the Java Memory Model. Suppose we start with a stack of:

![A diagram showing the initial state of the message stack as a linked list. The 'Head' points to 'Message A', which links sequentially to 'Message B', 'Message C', and 'Message D'.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgD58rsF7QpfHdZD0-4Y4YT4yn7pyFUvRU8ngHUs2T748AcOKAPQYJ_rn_dUg28-Q_Rc0XH3O7qlD9dGwMdoURapme0STqflbdfgUFqz9xBIjkx1Mn0GW_2H357NtAjHDiFGMEsv-GxLQTTN8qq8UycW_l-liJ6EliM76rUdhX0kMU15DjTMbT60I0-d1w/s16000/graphviz_linked.png)

We perform an atomic read of the head, and see A. A’s next pointer points to B. At the same time as we process B, the looper might remove B and C, by updating A to point to C and then D.

![A diagram illustrating a benign data race during list traversal. The Looper thread has updated 'Message A' to point directly to 'Message D', effectively removing 'Message B' and 'Message C'. Simultaneously, a concurrent thread reads a stale 'next' pointer from A, traverses through the logically removed messages B and C, and eventually rejoins the live list at 'Message D'.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiBEhPBhBTaFMF-1L8t05OMQMm08iWVMG_HGWmCLG9gjEJN87ScZLxovnX8VrbO4RFbRi_Ctw1_0U_BeQVIqAZ3emlxkPhvzXIg3WB3ijOOHRnkqJnnqo43l4G7P1WVU-y8IfENFunduyHnfUewRh2yf_4EM7sbo7BIZDPG1wsDWoN6WbHEePS39mwq1ZE=s16000)

Even though B and C are logically removed, B retains its next pointer to C, and C to D. The reading thread continues traversing through the detached removed nodes and eventually rejoins the live stack at D.

By designing DeliQueue to handle races between traversal and removal, we allow for safe, lock-free iteration.

Quitting: Native refcount

Looper is backed by a native allocation that must be manually freed once the Looper has quit. If some other thread is adding Messages while the Looper is quitting, it could use the native allocation after it’s freed, a memory safety violation. We prevent this using a tagged refcount, where one bit of the atomic is used to indicate whether the Looper is quitting.

Before using the native allocation, a thread reads the refcount atomic. If the quitting bit is set, it returns that the Looper is quitting and the native allocation must not be used. If not, it attempts a CAS to increment the number of active threads using the native allocation. After doing what it needs to, it decrements the count. If the quitting bit was set after its increment but before the decrement, and the count is now zero, then it wakes up the Looper thread.

When the Looper thread is ready to quit, it uses CAS to set the quitting bit in the atomic. If the refcount was 0, it can proceed to free its native allocation. Otherwise, it parks itself, knowing that it will be woken up when the last user of the native allocation decrements the refcount. This approach does mean that the Looper thread waits for the progress of other threads, but only when it’s quitting. That only happens once and is not performance sensitive, and it keeps the other code for using the native allocation fully lock-free.

![A state diagram illustrating the tagged refcount mechanism for safe termination. It defines three states based on the atomic value's layout (Bit 63 for teardown, Bits 0-62 for refcount): Active (Green): The teardown bit is 0. Workers successfully increment and decrement the reference count. Draining (Yellow): The Looper has set the teardown bit to 1. New worker increments fail, but existing workers continue to decrement. Terminated (Red): Occurs when the reference count reaches 0 while draining. The Looper is signaled that it is safe to destroy the native allocation.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhnTvDsIwwQfH8V_jK3KwyjtRolyycTjQqqezIEVYspluGZCVNIWpEJA7bFV2iEYXFpTF7XFfdoYaWVamWAre916Uv8nPhRJ7hOddqT2nEymLewlKXvRffzgYRneFMuxflq8GnPyaTf3-gMx-JDf3Jk6YIxP4fUAJ8TcSmGkcI82Pubf6R3YvSlcjoSd-U=s16000)

There’s a lot of other tricks and complexity in the implementation. You can learn more about DeliQueue by reviewing the source code.

Optimization: branchless programming

While developing and testing DeliQueue, the team ran many benchmarks and carefully profiled the new code. One issue identified using the [simpleperf tool](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/simpleperf) was pipeline flushes caused by the Message comparator code.

A standard comparator uses conditional jumps, with the condition for deciding which Message comes first simplified below:

```adb-detail__content
static int compareMessages(@NonNull Message m1, @NonNull Message m2) {
    if (m1 == m2) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Primary queue order is by when.
    // Messages with an earlier when should come first in the queue.
    final long whenDiff = m1.when - m2.when;
    if (whenDiff > 0) return 1;
    if (whenDiff < 0) return -1;

    // Secondary queue order is by insert sequence.
    // If two messages were inserted with the same `when`, the one inserted
    // first should come first in the queue.
    final long insertSeqDiff = m1.insertSeq - m2.insertSeq;
    if (insertSeqDiff > 0) return 1;
    if (insertSeqDiff < 0) return -1;

    return 0;
}
```

This code compiles to conditional jumps (b.le and cbnz instructions). When the CPU encounters a conditional branch, it can’t know whether the branch is taken until the condition is computed, so it doesn’t know which instruction to read next, and has to guess, using a technique called branch prediction. In a case like binary search, the branch direction will be unpredictably different at each step, so it’s likely that half the predictions will be wrong. Branch prediction is often ineffective in searching and sorting algorithms (such as the one used in a min-heap), because the cost of guessing wrong is larger than the improvement from guessing correctly. When the branch predictor guesses wrong, it must throw away the work it did after assuming the predicted value, and start again from the path that was actually taken - this is called a pipeline flush.

To find this issue, we profiled our benchmarks using the branch-misses performance counter, which records stack traces where the branch predictor guesses wrong. We then visualized the results with [Google pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof), as shown below:

![A screenshot from the pprof web UI showing branch misses in MessageQueue code to compare Message instances while performing heap operations.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhWzEoCloyBTPrjN-l1Z_g9erTzvYdJSAN_Kl03J5BqreA5Tdb_T9HG0LfenFzE2BkN5GTaeiIqAtQNqmcGjhTsu7vfEj2D-51hUjLaQssZo6pV8jiv8FtLFOmEnqZdfanKNYQ1oOWDAaKEzfSZbV9NVcxVYkXW_dw663Z5DDPUaS8NJwrXzSgTrxtT13k=s16000)

Recall that the original MessageQueue code used a singly-linked list for the ordered queue. Insertion would traverse the list in sorted order as a linear search, stopping at the first element that’s past the point of insertion and linking the new Message ahead of it. Removal from the head simply required unlinking the head. Whereas DeliQueue uses a min-heap, where mutations require reordering some elements (sifting up or down) with logarithmic complexity in a balanced data structure, where any comparison has an even chance of directing the traversal to a left child or to a right child. The new algorithm is asymptotically faster, but exposes a new bottleneck as the search code stalls on branch misses half the time.

Realizing that branch misses were slowing down our heap code, we optimized the code using branch-free programming:

```adb-detail__content
// Branchless Logic
static int compareMessages(@NonNull Message m1, @NonNull Message m2) {
    final long when1 = m1.when;
    final long when2 = m2.when;
    final long insertSeq1 = m1.insertSeq;
    final long insertSeq2 = m2.insertSeq;

    // signum returns the sign (-1, 0, 1) of the argument,
    // and is implemented as pure arithmetic:
    // ((num >> 63) | (-num >>> 63))
    final int whenSign = Long.signum(when1 - when2);
    final int insertSeqSign = Long.signum(insertSeq1 - insertSeq2);

    // whenSign takes precedence over insertSeqSign,
    // so the formula below is such that insertSeqSign only matters
    // as a tie-breaker if whenSign is 0.
    return whenSign * 2 + insertSeqSign;
}
```

To understand the optimization, [disassemble the two examples in Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/bvGh7aadG) and use [LLVM-MCA](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-mca.html), a CPU simulator that can generate an [estimated timeline of CPU cycles](https://godbolt.org/z/EYxn6MasE).

Note the one conditional branch, b.le, which avoids comparing the insertSeq fields if the result is already known from comparing the when fields.

Here, the branchless implementation takes fewer cycles and instructions than even the shortest path through the branchy code - it’s better in all cases. The faster implementation plus the elimination of mispredicted branches resulted in a 5x improvement in some of our benchmarks!

However, this technique is not always applicable. Branchless approaches generally require doing work that will be thrown away, and if the branch is predictable most of the time, that wasted work can slow your code down. In addition, removing a branch often introduces a data dependency. Modern CPUs execute multiple operations per cycle, but they can’t execute an instruction until its inputs from a previous instruction are ready. In contrast, a CPU can speculate about data in branches, and work ahead if a branch is predicted correctly.

## Testing and Validation

Validating the correctness of lock-free algorithms is notoriously difficult!

In addition to standard unit tests for continuous validation during development, we also wrote rigorous stress tests to verify queue invariants and to attempt to induce data races if they existed. In our test labs we could run millions of test instances on emulated devices and on real hardware.

With [Java ThreadSanitizer](https://github.com/google/java-thread-sanitizer) (JTSan) instrumentation, we could use the same tests to also detect some data races in our code. JTSan did not find any problematic data races in DeliQueue, but - surprisingly -actually detected two concurrency bugs in the Robolectric framework, which we promptly fixed.

To improve our debugging capabilities, we built new analysis tools. Below is an example showing an issue in Android platform code where one thread is overloading another thread with Messages, causing a large backlog, visible in Perfetto thanks to the MessageQueue instrumentation feature that we added.

![A screenshot of Perfetto UI, demonstrating flows and metadata for Messages being posted to a MessageQueue and delivered to a worker thread.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj6PDjipHRYCZTdaA0a9JAXFqW98l1DBKt1sJGKzSgxpYI9oevK5sjG7sdBHDCjwFyK9VZfTbmHmA5NK9Z5cJ5dLxFb7FP7Lw_07AmtaBT4yKs9Gsyz3QeeifZghO09Qk0ZTsbTIMVKmRrT34-VLQmB47qTTKPSm6BeSPiBSASooYIR5yR7AcoRV7utUKc=s16000)

To enable MessageQueue tracing in the system\_server process, include the following in your Perfetto configuration:

```adb-detail__content
data_sources {
  config {
    name: "track_event"
    target_buffer: 0  # Change this per your buffers configuration
    track_event_config {
      enabled_categories: "mq"
    }
  }
}
```

Impact

DeliQueue improves system and app performance by eliminating locks from MessageQueue.

- Synthetic benchmarks: multi-threaded insertions into busy queues is up to 5,000x faster than the legacy MessageQueue, thanks to improved concurrency (the Treiber stack) and faster insertions (the min-heap).
- In Perfetto traces acquired from internal beta testers, we see a reduction of 15% in app main thread time spent in lock contention.
- On the same test devices, the reduced lock contention leads to significant improvements to the user experience, such as:

## Next steps

DeliQueue is rolling out to apps in Android 17. App developers should review preparing your app for the new lock-free MessageQueue on the Android Developers blog to learn how to test their apps.
